Hello! I am an assistant professor at UC Berkeley, jointly appointed between the [Haas School of Business](https://haas.berkeley.edu/eap/) and the [Department of Economics](https://www.econ.berkeley.edu/).

My research focuses on the economics of science and innovation. I am interested in how the incentives that scientists face shape the production of new knowledge.
