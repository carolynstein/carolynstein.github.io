Hello! I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research ([SIEPR](https://siepr.stanford.edu/)). I work on topics at the intersection of labor economics and the economics of science and innovation.

In July 2022, I will join UC Berkeley as an assistant professor, jointly appointed between the [Haas School of Business](https://haas.berkeley.edu/eap/) and the [Department of Economics](https://www.econ.berkeley.edu/).

You can reach me at cstein2@stanford.edu.
